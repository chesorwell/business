# Digital Audit Assignment: The Kill Switches (Hypothesis Stress Test)

Without direct interaction (Secondary Research only), aggressively attempt to find finding hard evidence to **DISPROVE** the following hypothesis:

> **SMB Freight Brokers** are currently losing significant OpEx (Operational Expense) on **Manual Identity Vetting Checks** because of **The Industrialization of Fraud in 2024/2025**, which has rendered traditional database checks useless and forced them to revert to expensive manual phone verification.

**Deliverables**

1. **Problem**. Find evidence that problem is not significant to solve. Find:

   - **Satisfaction.** Are they actually happy with current solutions? Do they consider the problem "Solved" by these platforms?
   - **Triviality.** Is their current workaround "good enough"? Is it viewed as a minor annoyance rather than a significant OpEx drain?
   - **Apathy.** Do they see it as a cost of doing business? Do they even care about solving it? Do they seek for solutions?
   - **Declining Trend.** Is the problem getting better on its own?
   - **Greenfield Collapse.** Is there a recent solution that actually started solving this problem effectively?
   - **Other.** Are there any other reasons why this problem is not significant to solve?

2. **People**. Find evidence that there is either not enough people affected or it's very hard to reach them. Find:

   - **Niche Segment.** Is the problem only affecting a very small subset of SMB Freight Brokers?
   - **Limited Roles.** Are there only a few roles affected by this problem? Are these roles hard to reach or identify?
   - **Digital Absence.** Are these people not present in online communities, forums, or social media where we could find them?
   - **Contact Scarcity.** Is it difficult to find direct contact info for relevant people? Are they generally unresponsive to outreach?
   - **Contact Acquisition Barriers.** Are there significant barriers to finding more contacts like these in the future?
   - **Other.** Are there any other reasons why there is either not enough people affected or it's very hard to reach them?

3. **Solution**. Find evidence of invisible walls that make the solution unsellable or impossible. Find:

   - **The Trust Wall.** Explicit statements that they will never trust AI/Automation with vetting?
   - **Insurance Mandates.** Do cargo insurance policies require a human to perform specific verification?
   - **Hidden Decision Makers.** Is the vetting policy actually set by a team we cannot reach, rather than the Broker/Owner?
   - **Legal Barriers.** Are there legal or regulatory constraints that prevent automation or third-party solutions?
   - **Tech Stack Hostility.** Are their systems closed ecosystems that make it impossible for a 3rd party agent to integrate?
   - **Budget Constraints.** Are there explicit statements that they have no budget for solving this problem?
   - **Other.** Are there any other reasons why the solution is unsellable or impossible?
