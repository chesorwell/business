Here is the strategic summary and estimation report for Phase 1.

### **Phase 1: Executive Summary**

We executed a "Via Negativa" stress test across three market buckets to identify structural fatal flaws for a Solo Founder. **The "Allocators" bucket was permanently eliminated due to insurmountable regulatory and compliance friction, while "Info Middlemen" and "Experts" were retained as a merged candidate pool because their respective failures (Competitive Vacancy vs. Problem Awareness) are segment-specific risks, not structural impossibilities.**

### **Phase 1: Experiment Report**

**Objective:**
To filter three broad market categories (Info Middlemen, Experts, Allocators) against 9 strict criteria (e.g., Velocity, Solvability, Autonomy) to identify a single "Minimal Viable Segment" direction.

**Methodology:**
We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation (5 independent AI reasoning cycles) using a "Kill Analysis" prompt. The goal was to disprove the viability of each model rather than find reasons to like them.

**Results:**

1.  **Allocators:** 100% Failure Rate. (Structural Incompatibility).
2.  **Info Middlemen:** High Pass Rate, but flagged for "Red Ocean" risks.
3.  **Experts/Operators:** Mixed Results (Caution/Pass), flagged for "Sales Friction" and "Scalability" risks.

**The Decision:**
We have **Eliminated Allocators**. We have **Merged Info Middlemen & Experts** for Phase 2. We could not separate the latter two because they represent a tradeoff: Middlemen offer a perfect business model in a crowded market, while Experts offer a harder business model in a less crowded market. The winner depends on the specific niche, not the broad bucket.

### **Comparative Estimation Table**

The following table visualizes the "Structural Physics" of each bucket that led to this decision.

| Criteria                 | **1. Allocators** (Insurance/Risk)               | **2. Info Middlemen** (Connectors)     | **3. Experts/Operators** (Executors)        |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Accessibility**     | 🔴 **Fail** (Gatekeepers/Old Boys Networks)      | 🟢 **Pass** (Direct to decision maker) | 🟢 **Pass** (Direct to owner)               |
| **2. Purchasing Power**  | 🟢 **Pass** (High Capital)                       | 🟢 **Pass** (High Value Transactions)  | 🟢 **Pass** (High Hourly/Project fees)      |
| **3. Liquidity**         | 🟢 **Pass** (They sell money)                    | 🟡 **Caution** (Dependant on niche)    | 🟡 **Caution** (Feast/Famine cycles)        |
| **4. Decision Autonomy** | 🔴 **Fail** (Committees/Boards required)         | 🟢 **Pass** (One decision maker)       | 🟢 **Pass** (One decision maker)            |
| **5. Trans. Velocity**   | 🔴 **Fatal Fail** (Regulation/Compliance Sludge) | 🟢 **Pass** (Immediate need/result)    | 🟡 **Caution** (Trust-building takes time)  |
| **6. Problem Awareness** | 🟡 **Caution** (Risk is abstract)                | 🟢 **Pass** (Pain is obvious/urgent)   | 🔴 **Risk** (Requires Evangelism/Education) |
| **7. Tech Solvability**  | 🔴 **Fail** (Legal/Financial barriers, not code) | 🟢 **Pass** (Data matching/Scraping)   | 🟡 **Caution** (High human nuance)          |
| **8. Comp. Vacancy**     | 🟡 **Caution** (Established giants)              | 🔴 **Risk** (Red Ocean/Aggregators)    | 🟢 **Pass** (Inefficient competitors/Excel) |
| **9. Market Depth**      | 🟡 **Caution** (Niche limited)                   | 🟢 **Pass** (High volume)              | 🟢 **Pass** (High volume)                   |
| **VERDICT**              | **KILL (STRUCTURAL)**                            | **KEEP (MARKET RISK)**                 | **KEEP (EXECUTION RISK)**                   |

### **The "Why" Behind The Merge**

- **Allocators died** because they violate the **"Solo Founder Physics"** (Velocity, Autonomy, Solvability). You cannot code your way out of government regulations or insurance boards.
- **Info Middlemen survived** because the model is mechanically perfect for a tech stack (High Solvability, High Velocity), but it suffers from **External Saturation** (everyone knows it's a good model).
- **Experts survived** because they offer **Greenfield Opportunities** (Low Competition), but they suffer from **Internal Friction** (Need for education/sales).

**Next Step:** We proceed to Phase 2 to find specific niches that combine the _Solvability_ of a Middleman with the _Vacancy_ of an Expert.
