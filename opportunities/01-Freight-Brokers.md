## Category 4: Trends 🟡

- Natural Small Post COVID recession. Margins Drop in 2024 from 15–18% to 10–13% (AI search)
- "Mini-Bids" Trends. From long-term contracts to 3-6-months.
- Consolidation ("Agency Model") Trend. Work as an agent for 70% for a larger broker.
- "Double Brokering" reached crisis levels in 2023–2024. One survey found 85% of respondents were impacted by double-brokering fraud in 2023
- Shippers require brokers to have real-time tracking with subscriptions to even bid on freight.
- The most dangerous trend for SMBs right now is shippers demanding Net-90 payment terms while carriers demand Quick Pay (2 days). This gap is where most brokerages fail.
- The "purge" is largely over. Expected which should allow rates (and margins) to stabilize in late 2025. As of May 2025, the Outbound Tender Reject Index stood at 6.69%, suggesting modest tightening in capacity — a positive sign of a recovering freight market. However, small and medium brokerages that survived will need to invest significantly in technology and fraud prevention to remain competitive.
- specialized arrangements trend to protect the "race to the bottom".
- This trend has been building for 3+ years and is accelerating. Traditional brokers controlled 54.3% of 2024 gross revenue, but digital models are surging at a 17.0% CAGR, signaling a tectonic shift in how loads are sourced and priced. Digital platforms that quote pallet-level rates within seconds are winning volume from manual call-and-fax workflows.
- Smaller brokers lacking automated vetting tools struggle to keep pace, accelerating consolidation. The technology gap is stark: digitally empowered models can now move spot freight at a fraction of traditional costs by eliminating 90% or more of the manual touches on freight moved in-app, allowing an order-of-magnitude reduction in operating expenses.

## Category 4: Financial Capacity 🟡

1. What's typical annual revenue for SMB businesses in this market? 🟢 $5-50M (depending on the size. Usually if X employees => $XM revenue)

3. Are they known to spend money on software/services? 🟢 They will have to to survive.

- Revenue for small and medium-sized (SMB) freight brokerages varies significantly, but a common benchmark is a gross profit margin of 10-15% on each load. For example, a single broker who moves 10 loads a week could earn around $130,000 annually based on an average profit of $250 per load. An individual broker with $2 million in sales and a 15% profit margin would generate $300,000 in gross profit, before business expenses like rent and salaries are deducted.

2. Is this problem informational/software-solvable in nature? 🔴 Yes, verification is information processing and can be solved by software. But I am not very exited to do the "police" job, because it's basically fraud prevention and I believe if the laws would work better this thing would not be a problem.
3. Is there any public signal that people are aware of and talking about this problem? 🟢 Yes, a lot of complaints and even jokes (it became very spread and almost accepted) in Reddit.
