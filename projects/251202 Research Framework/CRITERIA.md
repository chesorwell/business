# Business Opportunity Criteria

The list of criteria is derived from the following two foundational assumptions:

**Assumption 1 (The Control Axiom):**
My success must depend **solely** on variables I can control (My Solution, Offer, Outreach, Delivery, etc.). Hence, these criteria must cover all variables that I **can't control** (Bureaucracy, Poverty, Technical Impossibility), so I can choose the market where success depends mostly on my actions.

**Assumption 2 (The Outbound Axiom):**
Given **a)** High-Ticket B2B, **b)** Bootstrapped (Finite Runway), **c)** Zero Network, **d)** Zero Brand Name, **e)** Unverified Product-Market Fit, and **f)** the physics of marketing (there are only 4 ways to acquire a customer: Warm, Cold, Content, Ads) — **Business SURVIVAL is a function of Cold Outreach, and nothing else.** Since Warm is impossible (no network), Content is too slow (no brand), and Ads are too risky (unproven offer), Cold Outreach is the only remaining mechanism to guarantee immediate deal flow and problem discovery.

Based on these assumptions, I derived the following **Business Opportunity Criteria** to evaluate potential markets:

1. **Accessibility & Receptivity [KILL_SWITCH]**
   The decision-maker must be directly reachable via public channels (Email, LinkedIn, Phone, Google Map, etc.) and the industry must be receptive enough to cold outreach. If the industry relies on "Old Boys' Networks," hidden gatekeepers, or requires physical presence to get a meeting, it violates the _Outbound Axiom_.

2. **Referencability [STRONG]**
   Early customers must be able and willing to refer others if I provided enough value for them. The industry should have professional communities, peer networks, or associations where word-of-mouth can travel. Avoid markets with competitive secrecy or where culture prevents customers from becoming referral sources.

3. **Decision Autonomy [KILL_SWITCH]**
   The person I contact must have the authority to unilaterally approve the purchase. I must avoid markets where the decision requires a Committee, a Board, or multiple department heads.

4. **Transaction Velocity [KILL_SWITCH]**
   The industry must be free of structural "Sludge." I must avoid markets with heavy **Compliance**, **Regulation**, or **Legal** bottlenecks.

5. **Purchasing Power & Liquidity [KILL_SWITCH]**
   The target sector must be financially healthy enough to pay for their pain. I must avoid "Desperate Markets" (e.g., struggling restaurants, low-margin retail) where cash flow is a constant emergency. Even if the problem is expensive (Purchasing Power), if they don't have cash in the bank (Liquidity), the deal dies.

6. **Market Size [KILL_SWITCH]**
   The market must have enough total economic value to support a $5M+ business. Wether it's via $10K from 500 customers or $500 from 10,000 customers, the math must work.

7. **Market Fragmentation [KILL_SWITCH]**
   The market must be structurally fragmented — meaning many independent businesses, not consolidated into a few dominant players.

8. **Recent Shift [STRONG]**
   The opportunity must be connected to a recent change. It should be either Emerging Problem (appeared recently due to environmental change) or a Newly Solvable Problem (An old, known problem that just became tractable due to a shift). If the problem is old and there's no recent shift that makes it newly solvable — that's a red flag.

9. **Problem Awareness & Urgency [KILL_SWITCH]**
   The target must already be aware of the pain and preferably urgent. I must **Capture Demand**, not create it. I should not educate them that they have a problem. Ideally, they should say "I'll pay you now $XXX if you can solve this".

10. **Recurrence [KILL_SWITCH]**
    The problem must be ongoing and operational, not a one-time event. This enables a subscription model where the solution becomes embedded in their workflow. Avoid problems that, once solved, don't recur.

11. **Technical Solvability (Digital Soil) [STRONG]**
    The market’s primary bottlenecks should be rooted in Information and Process Inefficiency, not physical or biological constraints, ensuring the problem is solvable purely by manipulating data, logic, and communication channels (Bits vs. Atoms). This allows me to leverage my full "Pro Generalist" stack (AI, Agents, APIs, Web Dev, Architecture) to engineer a solution.

12. **Switching Feasibility [STRONG]**
    The adoption of a new solution should bring 2 times more value than the pain of switching/integration. Light switching friction is fine (and helps retention later), but high barriers kill deals.

13. **Competitive Vacancy ("Shark" moat) [MEDIUM]**
    Make sure that there no existing VC-backed startups are already fighting for this market. It's even better to find a problem that VC-backed startups wouldn't be interested in solving.

14. **Entry Barrier ("Piranha" moat) [MEDIUM]**
    The business must be viable for me to succeed, but not too obvious for other to easily copy it. This is a soft gut check "Would a fresh grad recognize this as worth solving and be able to execute?". So the problem should be non-obvious problem (they wouldn't see it) and difficult enough to execute (they couldn't do it even if they saw it).
