This document integrates the methodology of _The Mom Test_ with your specific strategic context: a bootstrapped, B2B, tech-generalist founder with a finite runway ($110k) and a mandate for high-velocity learning.

This is your playbook for converting "Customer Discovery" from a vague activity into a rigorous mechanism for **Business Survival**.

### I. The Anti-Builder Mindset (Fighting Your Nature)

You are a Senior Engineer and AI Generalist. Your default instinct is to code solutions. _The Mom Test_ is your psychological firewall to prevent you from building before selling.

- **The Solution Firewall:** Never mention your tech stack (AI Agents, APIs, Automation) in the first conversation. If you mention "AI," they will talk about the _future_ (hype/fluff). If you talk about their _workflow_, they will talk about the _past_ (facts/pain).
- **The Ego Suppression Protocol:** You view business as a path to virtue and self-improvement. Therefore, treat a "failed" idea not as a personal failure, but as a successful navigational correction. A conversation that proves you _shouldn't_ build something saves you $10k of runway. That is a win.
- **The "Digital Soil" Excavator:** Since you are looking for "Human Middleware" problems (inefficiency), do not ask "What software do you need?" Ask, "Where do you currently use Excel to glue two systems together?" and "Walk me through the last time you had to stay late to fix data."
- **The Feature Request Trap:** If a prospect says, "It would be cool if it had an AI chatbot," disregard it. That is an idea. Instead, ask, "Why would that help? How are you handling customer queries right now without it?" Dig for the _motivation_, not the _feature_.

### II. The Cold Outreach "Chat" (Applying Mom Test to B2B Outbound)

You have no network (The Outbound Axiom). You must turn cold calls/emails into warm learning sessions without sounding like a desperate salesperson.

- **The "Student" Trojan Horse:** You cannot claim to be an expert yet. Use the "Vision/Framing/Weakness/Pedestal/Ask" framework from the book.
  - _Script:_ "I’m an engineer building tools to automate [Process X], but I’m trying to avoid building useless shelf-ware. You’re the expert on [Industry Y]. Could you spare 15 minutes to help me understand how you currently handle [Problem Z] so I don't waste my time?"
- **The 15-Minute Disqualification:** Your runway is your life. Do not let polite "Zombie Leads" eat your time. If they are not sharing concrete pains or spending money on the problem, end the call early. "It sounds like you guys have this under control, so I won't take more of your time."
- **The Competitor Anchor:** When they say, "We already use [Competitor X]," do not pitch against it. Ask, "How is that working for you? What’s the most annoying thing about it? Why haven't you switched yet?" This reveals the "switching cost"—a critical variable for your survival.
- **The Specifics-Only Rule:** In B2B, people speak in corporate buzzwords ("We need better synergy"). This is fluff. Ruthlessly cut through it: "Can you give me an example of the last time 'lack of synergy' cost you money?"

### III. Validating the "Fast Cash" Variables

Your criteria require High Margins, Liquidity, and Decision Autonomy. You must validate these _during_ the conversation, not after.

- **The Budget Autopsy:** You need to charge $2k–$10k+. You cannot guess their willingness to pay. Ask: "How much are you currently spending to solve this? Is that budget coming from IT or Operations?" If they don't know, they aren't the Decision Maker.
- **The Autonomy Test:** You need "One Contact = One Decision." Ask: "If you found a solution to this problem today, who else would need to sign off on it?" If they list a committee, the market segment violates your _Transaction Velocity_ criteria. Abort.
- **The "Workaround" Price Tag:** If they claim a problem is "critical," ask: "What are you doing right now to fix it?"
  - _Answer A:_ "Nothing." -> It’s not a critical problem.
  - _Answer B:_ "I hired a VA" or "I spend 4 hours a week on it." -> **Jackpot.** Calculate the cost of that workaround. That is your price anchor.
- **The Liquidity Check:** You need cash _now_. Look for signals of urgency. "Has this problem caused you to lose a deal or pay a fine in the last 3 months?" If the pain is theoretical, the cash is theoretical.

### IV. The Currency of Truth (Commitment & Advancement)

You are aiming for a Paid Pilot ($5k–$20k). A compliment ("This looks great") is worthless. You need skin in the game.

- **The Pilot Ultimatum:** Never leave a meeting with "Let me think about it." Push for a commitment that proves value. "If I can build a prototype that solves [Specific Pain] by next week, would you be willing to run a paid pilot for $2k?"
- **The Reputation Gamble:** If they can't pay yet (e.g., waiting for budget cycle), ask for _Reputation Currency_: "Can you introduce me to the VP of Operations to verify this workflow?" If they refuse, they are lying about the problem's importance.
- **The 2X Value Confirmation:** Before building, verbalize the ROI equation. "So, you're losing about $20k a year on this manual process. If I fix it for $5k, that's a no-brainer, right?" Watch their reaction. If they hesitate, you haven't found the real pain yet.
- **The False Positive Filter:** If they say, "I would definitely buy that," assume they are lying. Reply: "Great, I can take a deposit now to secure your spot in the beta." If they balk, the "would" was a lie.

### V. Segmentation & The "Navy SEALs" Approach

You are targeting cohorts of ≤50 contacts. _The Mom Test_ warns against "broad segments" causing mixed signals.

- **The Slicing Scalpel:** Do not target "Logistics Companies." Target "VPs of Operations at 3PLs in the Midwest with $10M-$50M revenue using legacy ERPs." If your feedback is inconsistent, your slice is too wide. Keep slicing until the problems sound identical.
- **The "Who-Where" Pair:** A segment is only valid if you know _who_ they are and _where_ to find them (LinkedIn, specific trade association). If you can't build a list of 50 names in an hour, the segment is too abstract.
- **The Consistency Signal:** Stop interviewing a segment when you stop hearing new things. If 5 people in a row complain about the exact same data entry bottleneck, you have hit **Market Depth**. Stop talking and start selling/building.

### VI. Operationalizing Wisdom (Learning Velocity)

You have a "Speed of Learning" mandate. You cannot be the bottleneck of your own business.

- **The Notes Mandate:** You cannot trust your memory. Use the symbol system (Lightning Bolt for Pain, Money Bag for Budget) during calls. Post-call, transfer these to a spreadsheet immediately. This is your "Database of Truth."
- **The Pre-Meeting "Three":** Never dial the phone without writing down the **3 Big Questions** you need to answer. Example: 1. Do they have budget? 2. Is this a top-3 priority? 3. Who signs the check?
- **The Review Ritual:** Review your notes weekly. Look for patterns in the "Lightning Bolts" (Pains). Are you hearing the same pain enough to build an SOP or an Agent around it?
- **The Separation of Powers:** You wear two hats: _The Researcher_ (Mom Test mode) and _The Closer_ (Sales mode). Do not mix them. In the first 15 minutes, you are a Researcher (Learning). Only once you confirm the pain and budget do you switch to Closer (Advancement).

### VII. Summary for the "Game"

In the context of your "Game":

- **Axioms:** _The Mom Test_ helps you discover _Axioms_ (Truths about the market) by stripping away social politeness.
- **Discovery:** It is the tool to fill your "Discoverable Variables" (Customer, Problem) with facts rather than assumptions.
- **Control:** It allows you to control the conversation by focusing on the past (certainty) rather than the future (speculation).
- **Survival:** By disqualifying bad leads and bad ideas _fast_, it protects your $110k runway more effectively than any financial budget could.
