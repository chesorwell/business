# Project Brief: Market-Problem Fit Identification

## 1. Project Objective

**Goal:** Identify **one specific, high-urgency operational problem** within the "Knowledge-Intensive Business Services" (KIBS) sector that is **emerging or worsening right now (in late 2024 / 2025)** due to recent external shifts.

## 2. The Scope

Do not look at general "Small Businesses.", look specifically at **KIBS** companies that fit into one of the two groups below:

### **Group A: Information Middlemen (Connectors)**

_Businesses that generate revenue by matching Supply with Demand._

- **Staffing & Recruiting:** (IT Staffing, Healthcare Locums, Executive Search, etc.).
- **Freight & Logistics:** (3PLs, Freight Forwarders, Non-Asset Based Carriers, etc.).
- **Real Estate Operators:** (Commercial Property Managers, HOA Management, Multifamily Operators, etc.).
- **Business Brokerages:** (M&A Advisors, SMB Brokers selling Main Street businesses, etc.).

### **Group B: Experts & Operators (Executors)**

_Businesses that sell expertise, specialized competence, or high-end execution._

- **Boutique Agencies:** (Specialized Marketing, Design/Dev Shops, Compliance Consultants, etc.).
- **Managed Service Providers (MSPs):** (Niche IT support, Cybersecurity firms, etc.).

## 3. The "Worthy Problem" Criteria

The problem you identify must meet **all three** of the following criteria:

1.  **Emerging / Urgent (The "Why Now?"):** The problem must be recently aggravated by external factors.
2.  **OpEx (Operational Expense) Focus:** The problem must bleed **OpEx** (wasted labor hours, daily inefficiencies, fines), NOT CapEx (Capital Expenditure/Infrastructure).
3.  **High Frequency:** The pain must be felt **Daily, Weekly or Monthly**. (Avoid annual/quarterly problems).

## 4. Research Guidelines

- Use credible sources: industry reports, news articles/reports, new regulations, expert interviews, market analyses, etc. Avoid unverifiable sources.
- Focus ONLY on "Voice of the Customer" and ABSOLUTELY AVOID generic "Top Trends" blog posts from software vendors!
- Absolutely AVOID Old and Outdated Sources and Problems. Focus on problems that are **currently emerging or worsening in late 2024 / 2025**.

## 5. Required Deliverables

Produce a report with the following structure:

**Section 1: The Top 3 Emerging Bottlenecks**
Identify the 3 most dangerous operational problems found across the defined scope. For each, strictly provide:

- **The Problem Name:** A concise title for the bottleneck.
- **The Trigger:** What specific recent event or trend caused this to become a problem _now_?
- **The Victim:** Which specific sub-segment suffers most?
- **The Cost:** What and How much do they lose because of this problem?
- **The Current Solution/Workaround:** How are they dealing with this problem right now?

**Section 2: The Evidence (Logical Proof)**
For the single strongest candidate, provide **Logical Proof** AND **Data Points** found in your search proving that this is a current, active pain point.
