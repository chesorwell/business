# GIVEN

## FACTS

- **Bio**. I am 33 years old, male, in a perfect health, energy and mindset. I am single, don't have or plan to have children and I am logistically flexible, I can live anywhere in the USA (I have a Green Card).
- **Personal Meaning of "Business"**. To live, one must constantly grow, becoming a better version of himself. Refusing this principle means implicitly choosing a slow death. Building a business as an independent entity is the ultimate catalyst for this because it demands of you to become a complete human being. You won't get away if you remain a narrow specialist. To conceive an entity in my mind and shape reality to sustain it requires mastering every fundamental aspect of life. Unlike raising a child, where genetics and chance play a bigger role than your personal contribution, a business is a pure, unforgiving reflection of its creator. I build not only for the result (Financial Freedom), but because the process forces me to evolve into a better version of myself. Even when I achieve Financial Freedom, I will continue playing this game, constantly trying to double the amount of money I make, because when you play this game in this way—the amount of money is a quantitative score of my virtue. I shall play this game for one single reason: because I am alive and I love this Life.
- **Skill Leverage Strategy**. I must actively fight the tendency to double down on my technical strengths, which would trap me as a specialist. Instead, I will aggressively prioritize acquiring the fundamental skills of a businessman: Sales, Strategy, Operations, and Delegation. My goal is to shift from _execution_ to _leverage_ - using my technical background only as a launchpad while I build the systems that replace me. I am prepared to stop coding entirely to ensure I am building a business that runs as an independent asset, not a job dependent on my labor.
- **Business in a "Right Way" (Wisdom)**. Doing business the "Right Way" does not mean perfectionism or seeking absolute certainty. It means cultivating the wisdom to balance action with analysis. Business is not Chess (perfect information); it is Poker (placing the best bets under uncertainty and your own knowledge of the world). The goal is not to guarantee success — which is impossible — but to guarantee that the _decision-making process_ was sound based on the available information. True wisdom lies in knowing _when_ to act on a whim and _when_ to strategize deeply, understanding trade-offs, and avoiding both blind motion and analysis paralysis. It is about making educated bets and systematically learning from the outcomes.
- **Cash Runway**. I've accumulated $110k cash runway (≈1.5 years to survive without income) and quit my job as a Senior Software Engineer. I have to use these money for both - living and business in a way that I won't need to return back to work for someone else, because in that case I would be loosing the most valuable asset I have - my time, which is my life. I live in New York, but to extend the runways I am going to live in other cities until I can afford the NYC costs. So I have to think how to spend money and where to live not to save money, but to make profit that will allow me to survive (and eventually thrive) in my business in the "Right Way" described above.
- **Speed of Business Learning**. To ensure I never return to a job, I must prioritize the **Speed of Learning** and **Transformation** above all else. I cannot demand certainty from the market, but I can demand progress from myself. My security comes from my skills, not my bank balance; if I learn how to be a businessman fast enough, money will follow. I will avoid "Gambling" (high-risk VC plays that rely on luck) and "Stagnation" (safe lifestyle businesses that rely on technical execution). Instead, I will place bets that maximize my exposure to business realities (Sales, Operations, Strategy). A "good" decision is one that accelerates my evolution from Specialist to Business Owner. I am racing against my cash runway, and the only way to win is to out-learn the burn rate.
- **Long-term vs Short-term goals**. My long-term dream is to build and sell businesses, even after I achieved Financial Freedom. And to get there in best and most robust way is to start small but in the right direction. So my current goal is to at least break even every year (≈$160k per year personally), but most importantly guaranteeing that I am doing the most important things - building my business. Otherwise I would have to return to work for someone else, which is absolute waste of my time and life. This is the absolute first and minimal step. After I achieved that I am going to reinvest all the profit into my business until I can scale and exit it, buying Financial Freedom (business is sold for ≈$3M or generates ≈$600k in profit with me working there less than 10 hours per week) and being ready for the next Business Challenge.
- **Fast Learner Technical Generalist**. I am a PRO Generalist, not a Specialist (I may not be a super expert in one domain, but I am very good at fast learning and solving business problems from the first principles and then figuring out what has to be done to solve the problem). It does not mean that I HAVE TO be a generalist, I understand that it's a disaster on the market, it rather means that I can choose pretty confidently any narrow direction and bet that I'll be successful in it. My particular technical strengths are: AI(Prompt Engineering and Agentic Development), Web Development, Fast Prototyping/MVP Development, Business Automation, Proof of Concept Research, High-Level Architecture Design, Trade-Offs Analysis. I learn and dive into unknown contexts very fast. I can understand how any given business work very fast when I talk to someone who is working in that business.
- **No existing Network**. I don't have any network to leverage for my business. I am originally from Russia and I have connections there, so I could potentially leverage the cheaper labor market and outsource some of the work there. I don't have a co-founder and I personally believe that to invite a co-founder (like any other employee, but even more important) must have a clear reason, clear separation of responsibilities. But most importantly I don't believe in the power of Network (result), but I do believe in the power of Networking (process). Meaning it's not your network that matters, but how fast and efficiency you get build the right network. And to be honest I'm pretty good at it.
- **No preferences for any "piece"**. I don't have any particular strengths or preferences in any specific domain. My only passion is seeing my progress. My personal product is not Software (product) or satisfied customer (niche) or their problem (market), so I don't care much what problem, how I will solve it and for whom, as long as all of these pieces come together very well (market, product, my strengths, etc). So my personal product is the business that integrates properly all of these pieces in the best way possible. So I have zero preferences for the pieces as long as it contributes to a bigger whole - growth of the business.
- **Constant Strategic Battle**. I hate equally two extremes: Analysis Paralysis and a Blind Random Motion. But I am constantly fighting these two tendencies. I understand that one can never be certain about things and building a business is mostly about making the right bets taking into account the trade-offs. But I believe that I absolutely MUST understand the reason and the expectations of my actions.
- **B2B Only**. I only going to focus on B2B and completely disregard B2C, because: a) Average time to profitability: B2B = 11 months vs B2C = 19 months b) Success rates for first-time founders reaching $1M revenue: B2B = 18% vs B2C = 9% c) Exit multiples: B2B SaaS = 3-5x revenue vs B2C SaaS = 1.5-3x revenue d) B2C is mostly focused on GROWTH for a long timer before generating any profit, e) B2C is higher risk and higher reward and f) B2C is way more price sensitive.

## THE GAME

**Objective (the whole game/process)**
To build a business in the "Right" way that runs without me (Asset) before I run out of money ($110k / ~1.5 years).

**End Goal (the final state)**
To reach a state where I have a **Specific Customer** with a **Specific Problem** solved by a **Specific Solution** that is delivered automatically (via Code/SaaS or Systems/Operations). That generates either $600k in profit per year with me working there less than 10 hours per week or can be sold for a multiple (3-5x) that ensures Financial Freedom (≈$3M+).

**The Variables:**

In business, like in life there are two kind of things - "Things to be Discovered" (Objective Facts, Market, Problems, etc) and "Things to be Conceived" (Values, Solutions, Offers, etc).

**Discoverable Variables:**

1. **Axioms** - What are the important and relevant truths about the world(market)?`
1. **Customer** - Who is the customer?
1. **Channels** - How to reach them?
1. **Problems** - What problem(s) do they have?

**Conceivable Variables:**

1. **Marketing** - How do I use the discovered channels to reach the customer?
2. **Solution** - What solution (in principle) will solve their problem?
3. **Offer** - What solution (specific) on which terms and price will I sell it?
4. **Sales** - How do I communicate the offer to the customer?
5. **Delivery** - How do I deliver the sold solution to the customer?
6. **Numbers** - How do I make the math work? (Revenue, Cost, Profit, etc.)

### Market Scope Criteria

The list of criteria is derived from the following two foundational assumptions:

**Assumption 1 (The Control Axiom):**
My success must depend **solely** on variables I can control (My Solution, Offer, Outreach, Delivery, etc.). Hence, these criteria must cover all variables that I **can't control** (Bureaucracy, Poverty, Technical Impossibility), so I can choose the market where success depends mostly on my actions.

**Assumption 2 (The Outbound Axiom):**
Given **a)** High-Ticket B2B, **b)** Bootstrapped (Finite Runway), **c)** Zero Network, **d)** Zero Brand Name, **e)** Unverified Product-Market Fit, and **f)** the physics of marketing (there are only 4 ways to acquire a customer: Warm, Cold, Content, Ads) — **Business SURVIVAL is a function of Cold Outreach, and nothing else.** Since Warm is impossible (no network), Content is too slow (no brand), and Ads are too risky (unproven offer), Cold Outreach is the only remaining mechanism to guarantee immediate deal flow and problem discovery.

To be valid, a market scope must pass **ALL** of the following filters:

1. **Accessibility (Can I reach them?)**
   The decision-maker must be directly reachable via public channels (Email, Phone, LinkedIn). If the industry relies on "Old Boys' Networks," hidden gatekeepers, or requires physical presence to get a meeting, it violates the _Outbound Axiom_.

2. **Purchasing Power (Is the problem expensive?)**
   The target must routinely pay significant amounts ($2k–$10k+) to solve business problems. The math of a Solo Founder with limited runway requires **High Margins** to survive. I cannot afford to sell low-ticket items that require high volume.

3. **Liquidity (Do they have cash _now_?)**
   The target sector must be financially healthy. I must avoid "Desperate Markets" (e.g., struggling restaurants, low-margin retail) where cash flow is a constant emergency. Even if the problem is expensive (Purchasing Power), if they don't have cash in the bank (Liquidity), the deal dies.

4. **Decision Autonomy (Who signs the check?)**
   The person I contact must have the authority to unilaterally approve the purchase. I must avoid markets where the decision requires a Committee, a Board, or multiple department heads. **One Contact = One Decision.**

5. **Transaction Velocity (Is the process fast?)**
   Even with Autonomy, the industry must be free of structural "Sludge." I must avoid markets with heavy **Compliance**, **Regulation**, or **Legal** bottlenecks (e.g., Government, Hospitals, Public Schools) where a "Yes" takes 3 months to become a "Check."

6. **Problem Awareness (Do they know it?)**
   The target must already be aware of the pain. I am here to **Capture Demand**, not create it. If I have to spend my limited runway educating the client that the problem exists (Evangelism), the scope is invalid.

7. **Technical Solvability (Digital Soil).**
   The market’s primary bottlenecks must be rooted in Information and Process Inefficiency, not physical or biological constraints, ensuring the problem is solvable purely by manipulating data, logic, and communication channels (Bits vs. Atoms). This allows me to leverage my full "Pro Generalist" stack (AI, Agents, APIs, Web Dev, Architecture) to engineer a solution, rather than hitting a wall where code is powerless against physical reality (e.g., I can fix a "Scheduling Mess" or "Lost Orders" via software, but I cannot fix "Spoiling Food" or a "Leaking Roof").

8. **Market Depth (Is there enough inventory?)**
   The total addressable prospect list must be large enough (Thousands, not Hundreds) to support a high-volume learning phase. I will burn through 90% of leads while learning; a "small pond" ensures I run out of prospects before I figure out the puzzle.
