## FACTS

- **BECOMING is the meaning of Business**
  To live, one must constantly grow, becoming a better version of himself. Refusing this principle means implicitly choosing a slow death. Building a business as an independent entity is the ultimate catalyst for this because it demands of you to become a complete human being. You won't get away if you remain a narrow specialist. To conceive an entity in my mind and shape reality to sustain it requires mastering every fundamental aspect of life. Unlike raising a child, where genetics and chance play a bigger role than your personal contribution, a business is a pure, unforgiving reflection of its creator. I build not only for the result (Financial Freedom), but because the process forces me to evolve into a better version of myself. Even when I achieve Financial Freedom, I will continue playing this game, constantly trying to double the amount of money I make, because when you play this game in this way—the amount of money is a quantitative score of my virtue. I shall play this game for one single reason: because I am alive and I love this Life.
- **My Strengths**
  I am a PRO Generalist, not a Specialist (I may not be a super expert in one domain, but I am very good at fast learning and solving problems from the first principles and then figuring out what has to be done to solve the problem). It does not mean that I HAVE TO be a generalist, I understand that it's a disaster on the market, it rather means that I can choose pretty confidently any narrow direction and bet that I'll be successful in it. My particular technical strengths are: AI(Prompt Engineering and Agentic Development), Web Development, Fast Prototyping/MVP Development, Business Automation, Proof of Concept Research, High-Level Architecture Design, Trade-Offs Analysis. I learn and dive into unknown contexts very fast. I can understand how any given business work very fast when I talk to someone who is working in that business.
- **LEVERAGE but STOP DEVELOPING technical skills**
  Being a 15+ years Software Engineer, I feel like God here. I have a really huge tech scope, particularly in Web Full Stack Development, API integrations and AI Engineering. I don't mind to LEVERAGE these skills, but I have to absolutely stop DEVELOPING them, because it's a trap - comfortable technician trap. I will only develop ARCHITECTURAL skills to keep up with tech and be able to USE it in my business by making decisions rather than building it with my hands. So I deliberately refuse to continue EVER developing my technical skills. Even if I will fail in this venture I will get a lower payable job as a Sales Person, but I will never again be back being a comfortable technician. I shall stop digging the whole of regret
- **BUSINESS VIRTUES vs TECHNICAL VICES**
  Being a technical guy, I must pay close attention to the most common technical vices that most technical founders fall into. I shall focus on:
  1. **Problem Discovery** over Solution Hallucination. Find a problem worthy of solving, not a solution worthy of discovery where to apply it.
  2. **Closing** over Rejection Avoidance. I am a hard closer and not a "smart pusyfier", who is always avoiding rejection.
  3. **Packaging** over Feature Description. I communicate with empathy talking about the benefits and the outcomes, not about the features and irrationally rational pitches.
  4. **Essentialism** over Perfectionism. I shall always build only absolutely necessary things, even if they "look horrible" to me as a technician. The product shall be pushed to the market if it is good enough.
  5. **Business Math** over Performance. It's all about Profit, CAC, Churn, LTV, MRR and other metrics that matter. And not Runtime, Latency, or the worst one of all - Clean Code.
  6. **Delegation** over "I'll do it myself". I shall delegate everything that can be delegated, even if it'll be done two times worse than if I did it myself. As long as it's sufficient and the numbers are working, I shall delegate!
- **LEARNING SPEED IS PRIORITY**
  Time is the most precious resource. I cannot demand certainty from the market, but I can demand the progress from myself. My security comes from my skills, not my bank balance; if I learn how to be a businessman fast enough, money will come. I will avoid "Gambling" (high-risk VC plays) and "Stagnation" (safe "do what you love" lifestyle businesses). I shall chose that Business Game that maximizes my learning speed because this is the fastest way to succeed. Even if I won't succeed in this venture and will have to get a job, the skills I'll acquire will increase my chances of success in my next venture.
- **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE**
  The most reliable competitive advantage which almost guarantees that I will always be ahead of the pack is to recognize obvious SIMPLE, but not EASY things in business. They are:

  1. **Acceleration vs Speed**. Most smart people are afraid to leave their comfort zone where they are PRO and rarely advanced on the new territories where they SUCK. And instead keep double investing on their existing skills. I am a super fast learner and shall double invest on any skills or domain knowledge which is the RIGHT to learn, even if I currently suck at it.
  2. **Cold Outreach** potential clients. Including interviewing them when you have nothing to sell. Follow up on not responded emails. Ask "Why" even after they reject you. Analyze rejections with curiosity.
  3. **Listening and Empathy**. Specialist think that they "know", interrupt and push their "smart reason" missing out that Listening and Empathy is not only allows you to learn way more things (there is always something to learn), but most importantly it allows you to make people WANT to listen to you.
  4. **Essentialism**. Specialists have hard time using boring tech stack, delivering ugly code or solving something manually if it can be automated "in 5 minutes". I shall focus on Efficiency and Simplicity to get the job done and iterated fast no matter what technology I use, wether it's manual or else. I shall only think about automation, polishing or optimization when and if it's needed. I shall also "Kill my darlings" when I see that it's no longer adding value without any Sunk Costs.
  5. **No to shortcuts**. I shall refuse any projects that don't move me forward my goals even if it's an "easy cash".
  6. **Under-promising**. Most specialists over promise and under deliver. I shall say "I can deliver it in 3 day" even if I think I can do it in 1.
  7. **Value Oriented Prices**. I shall ignore the COST when thinking of how much I will charge. Most people think "cost + margin = price". I shall think "value = price". So even if it costs me nothing to deliver, I shall charge as much as I possibly can confidently with cool. And when I say "It'll cost you approximately $20k" and then I shut up, because who ever speaks next will lose.
  8. **Confidence (embracing weaknesses)**. I shall openly accept my mistakes and weaknesses. I shall easily say "I fucked it up", "I am stuck on X, can you help me?", ask "dum" questions when it's needed and give deserved credits to my competitors with cool and confidence.

- **ANALYSIS PARALYSIS vs RANDOM MOTION**
  I hate equally two extremes: Analysis Paralysis and a blind Random Motion. But I am constantly fighting these two tendencies. I understand that one can never be certain about things and building a business is mostly about making the right bets taking into account the trade-offs. But I believe that I absolutely MUST understand the reason and the expectations of my actions.
- **RIGHT WAY is not PERFECTIONISM**
  Doing business the "Right Way" does not mean perfectionism or seeking absolute certainty. It means cultivating the wisdom to balance action with analysis. Business is not Chess (perfect information); it is Poker (placing the best bets under uncertainty and your own knowledge of the world). The goal is not to guarantee success — which is impossible — but to guarantee that the decision-making process was sound based on the available information. True wisdom lies in knowing when to act on a whim and when to strategize deeply, understanding trade-offs, and avoiding both blind motion and analysis paralysis. It is about making educated bets and systematically learning from the outcomes.
- **NO PREFERENCES**
  I hate the mantra "Do what you love" because no one gives a fuck about it. But I do believe in a disciplined value delivery. I don't have any particular strengths or preferences in any specific domain, but even if I would, it would be rather my weakness and distraction. I don't care what problem I will solve, but I do care about choosing WHICH and WHOSE problem is worthy of solving and then by solving it exceptionally well, building a business exceptionally well. I am passionate about doing whatever is "Right". Even if I hate it, I believe in the power of choice, so I'll chose to love it precisely because it is the right thing to do.

- **ENERGY and LOGISTICS**
  I am 33 years old, male, in a perfect health, energy and mindset. I am single, don't have or plan to have children and I am logistically flexible, I can live anywhere in the USA (I have a Green Card).
- **CASH RUNWAY: 1.5 years**
  I've accumulated $110k cash runway (≈1.5 years to survive without income) and quit my job as a Senior Software Engineer. I have to use these money for both - living and business in a way that I won't need to return back to work for someone else, because in that case I would be loosing the most valuable asset I have - my time, which is my life. I live in New York, but to extend the runways I am going to live in other cities until I can afford the NYC costs. So I have to think how to spend money and where to live not to save money, but to make profit that will allow me to survive (and eventually thrive) in my business in the "Right Way" described above.
- **NO NETWORK**
  I don't want to chose a business based on my existing network, because I don't want to be biased by it and I'm pretty good at learning new domains fast and developing new networks when needed.

- **B2B ONLY**
  I consider B2B only simply because chances here are higher than for B2C.
  1. B2B Cold Outreach(early close worthy engagement and sales) vs B2C Paid Ads(no direct engagement).
  2. Average time to profitability: B2B = 11 months vs B2C = 19 months
  3. Success rates for first-time founders reaching $1M revenue: B2B = 18% vs B2C = 9%
  4. Exit multiples: B2B SaaS = 3-5x revenue vs B2C SaaS = 1.5-3x revenue
  5. B2C is mostly focused on GROWTH for a long timer before generating any profit
  6. B2C is higher risk and higher reward
  7. B2C is way more price sensitive
  8. B2C has higher chore rate. You constantly need to get new users to at least stay on the flow.
  9. B2C has weaker moat against VC competitors and big companies. It's more "Winner Takes All" game.
  10. In B2C you need more polished UX/UI. In B2B they'll pay as long as you solve their problem.
  11. You can solve YOUR "B2C" itches way more efficiently when you keep business and hobbies separate.
- **LONG($600k/$3M) vs SHORT($160k) term goals**
  My long-term dream is to build and sell businesses, even after I achieved Financial Freedom. And to get there in best and most robust way is to start small but in the right direction. So my current goal is to at least break even every year (≈$160k per year personally), but most importantly guaranteeing that I am doing the most important things - building my business. Otherwise I would have to return to work for someone else, which is absolute waste of my time and life. This is the absolute first and minimal step. After I achieved that I am going to reinvest all the profit into my business until I can scale and exit it, buying Financial Freedom (business is sold for ≈$3M or generates ≈$600k in profit with me working there less than 10 hours per week) and being ready for the next Business Challenge.

## THE GAME

**Objective (the whole game/process)**
To build a business in the "Right" way that runs without me (Asset) before I run out of money ($110k / ~1.5 years).

**End Goal (the final state)**
To reach a state where I have a **Specific Customer** with a **Specific Problem** solved by a **Specific Solution** that is delivered automatically (via Code/SaaS or Systems/Operations). That generates either $600k in profit per year with me working there less than 10 hours per week or can be sold for a multiple (3-5x) that ensures Financial Freedom (≈$3M+).

**The Variables:**

In business, like in life there are two kind of things - "Things to be Discovered" (Objective Facts, Market, Problems, etc) and "Things to be Conceived" (Values, Solutions, Offers, etc).

**Discoverable Variables:**

1. **Axioms** - What are the important and relevant truths about the world(market)?`
1. **Customer** - Who is the customer?
1. **Channels** - How/Where to reach them?
1. **Problems** - What problem(s) do they have?

**Conceivable Variables:**

1. **Marketing** - How do I use the discovered channels to reach the customer?
2. **Solution** - What solution (in principle) will solve their problem?
3. **Offer** - What solution (specific) on which terms and price will I sell it?
4. **Sales** - How do I communicate the offer to the customer?
5. **Delivery** - How do I deliver the sold solution to the customer?
6. **Numbers** - How do I make the math work? (Revenue, Cost, Profit, etc.)

**General Execution Strategy**

In principles, the game must be executed in the following order:

- Phase 1 (100% Discovery): Discover the Right Opportunity (Customer + Problem + Channels).
- Phase 2 (50% Discovery, 50% Innovation): Conceive the Right Solution (Solution + Offer + Sales + Delivery).
- Phase 3 (0% Discovery, 0% Innovation, 100% Orchestration): Optimize, Systematize and Scale.

## Step 1. Business Opportunity Criteria

The list of criteria is derived from the following two foundational assumptions:

**Assumption 1 (The Control Axiom):**
My success must depend **solely** on variables I can control (My Solution, Offer, Outreach, Delivery, etc.). Hence, these criteria must cover all variables that I **can't control** (Bureaucracy, Poverty, Technical Impossibility), so I can choose the market where success depends mostly on my actions.

**Assumption 2 (The Outbound Axiom):**
Given **a)** High-Ticket B2B, **b)** Bootstrapped (Finite Runway), **c)** Zero Network, **d)** Zero Brand Name, **e)** Unverified Product-Market Fit, and **f)** the physics of marketing (there are only 4 ways to acquire a customer: Warm, Cold, Content, Ads) — **Business SURVIVAL is a function of Cold Outreach, and nothing else.** Since Warm is impossible (no network), Content is too slow (no brand), and Ads are too risky (unproven offer), Cold Outreach is the only remaining mechanism to guarantee immediate deal flow and problem discovery.

To be valid, a market scope must pass **ALL** of the following filters:

1. **Accessibility (Can I reach them?)**
   The decision-maker must be directly reachable via public channels (Email, LinkedIn, Phone, Google Map, etc.). If the industry relies on "Old Boys' Networks," hidden gatekeepers, or requires physical presence to get a meeting, it violates the _Outbound Axiom_.

2. **Purchasing Power & Liquidity**
   The target sector must be financially healthy enough to pay for their pain. I must avoid "Desperate Markets" (e.g., struggling restaurants, low-margin retail) where cash flow is a constant emergency. Even if the problem is expensive (Purchasing Power), if they don't have cash in the bank (Liquidity), the deal dies.

3. **Decision Autonomy**
   The person I contact must have the authority to unilaterally approve the purchase. I must avoid markets where the decision requires a Committee, a Board, or multiple department heads.

4. **Transaction Velocity**
   The industry must be free of structural "Sludge." I must avoid markets with heavy **Compliance**, **Regulation**, or **Legal** bottlenecks.

5. **Market Fragmentation**
   The market must be sufficiently fragmented to ensure that there are enough potential customers whom I can reach out.

6. **Problem Awareness**
   The target must already be aware of the pain. I must **Capture Demand**, not create it. I should not educate them that they have a problem. Ideally, they should say "I'll pay you now $XXX if you can solve this".

7. **Technical Solvability (Digital Soil).**
   The market’s primary bottlenecks should be rooted in Information and Process Inefficiency, not physical or biological constraints, ensuring the problem is solvable purely by manipulating data, logic, and communication channels (Bits vs. Atoms). This allows me to leverage my full "Pro Generalist" stack (AI, Agents, APIs, Web Dev, Architecture) to engineer a solution.

8. **Emerging Problem**
   If the problem is too old and well-known, it's a red flag because it's MOST LIKELY(BUT NOT GUARANTEED) either "Nature of the Business", does not make financial sense to solve it or some other fundamental reason why it wasn't solved yet.

9. **Competitive Vacancy**
   Make sure that there no existing VC-backed startups are already fighting for this market. It's even better to find a problem that VC-backed startups wouldn't be interested in solving.

10. **Market Size**
    The total addressable prospect list must be large enough to support a high-volume learning phase and future scale.

11. **Entry Barrier**
    The business must be viable for me to succeed, but not too obvious for other to easily copy it. I have to keep in mind both - individual freelancers and VC-backed startups.

## Step 2. Market Direction

Based on our criteria our Market Scope is **Knowledge-Intensive Business Services (KIBS)**, that includes the two following sub-categories:

1. Info Middlemen (Connect supply with demand without owning either; e.g., Recruiters/Headhunters matching talent to companies, Freight Brokers matching shippers to trucks, Real Estate/Business Brokers matching buyers to sellers, or Lead Generators selling prospect lists).
2. Experts (Sell specialized competence to execute or optimize a specific business function; e.g., Marketing Agencies managing growth, Compliance/Legal Consultants navigating regulations, Custom Software Shops building products, or Property Managers handling daily operations).
