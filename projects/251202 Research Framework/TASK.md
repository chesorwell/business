# Task Specification: Research Framework Design

## Context

I am a bootstrapped, solo founder with an IT background, looking for a B2B problem worthy of solving. I have defined 14 criteria that a business opportunity must satisfy (see: Business Opportunity Criteria). I have no pre-selected market or niche — I am starting from zero.

## The Problem This Framework Must Solve

I need a systematic way to discover and validate potential business opportunities through secondary research, before investing time in primary research (discovery interviews).

The framework must balance two competing needs:

1. **Efficiency** — I cannot spend days researching every possible niche. Dead ends must be killed quickly and cheaply.

2. **Coverage** — I cannot afford to miss good opportunities simply because I didn't look in the right place or dismissed something too early.

## What the Framework Must Do

1. **Generate candidates** — Provide a method for surfacing potential markets/niches worth investigating, without requiring me to already know where to look.

2. **Filter progressively** — Apply my 14 criteria in a structured order, using cheap/fast checks early and expensive/slow checks later.

3. **Define exit conditions** — Tell me when an opportunity is worth advancing to primary research, and when to kill it.

4. **Handle failure gracefully** — If a deep-dive fails, the framework should specify what happens next (backtrack? restart? how far?).

5. **Be executable** — Each step must be concrete enough that I know exactly what to do, what tools to use, and what output to produce.

## What the Framework Must NOT Do

- Require me to already have a market hypothesis
- Require TOO expensive tools or paid databases with marginal value (but I can spend hundreds and thousands if there is a reason for it)
- Spend equal time on all candidates regardless of viability
- Leave ambiguity about when to stop or proceed

## Success Criteria

The framework is successful if:

- I can follow it from "zero ideas" to "one validated opportunity worth pursuing with primary research"
- I can execute it solo, with publicly available resources
- It minimizes wasted time on obviously bad opportunities
- It maximizes the chance of finding non-obvious good opportunities

## Deliverable

A complete, step-by-step research framework that I can execute immediately, including:

- How to generate initial candidates
- What to check at each stage
- How much time/effort to allocate per stage
- When to advance, kill, or restart
- What tools/resources to use at each stage
