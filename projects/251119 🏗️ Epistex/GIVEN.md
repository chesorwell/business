### Primary Aim (Why) and Strategic Objective (Metrics)

My Primary Aim - Why do I want to build a business?

Constant growing and becoming a better version of myself is my purpose of life. All of my aspects in life (health, mindset, relationships, finances, etc.) are perfect. The most significant contribution in my life I can make by building a business "That works" not only to buy me Financial Freedom but most importantly it will demand me to grow, change and become a better version of myself. So for the rest of my life I want to build and sell one business after another.

Since I never built and sold any business, I don't want to play the "Startups"(backed by VCs) games or most importantly "life-style" games. I think of this as going to the gym - if I want to lift 300lb, I may try this weight for 10 years and probably never achieve it. But if I start with 100lb and increase it by 10lb every week, I will rapidly progress and will be able to lift 300lb in a year. The same I think about my first business game - I want to play by cards(my strengths, weaknesses, etc) in the way that increases the chances of success.

So as the first step in my business game, my **Primary Aim** is to build a B2B Software Development Agency in the "Right Way". I want to achieve the state where a) the business is not completely dependent on me and b) we can either continue to scale our business system as an agency or by working with a specific customers we found and opportunity for SaaS (because usually it's easier to sell a SaaS company than a service company). But for now my plan minimum is NOT TO FAIL - meaning I can work on MY BUSINESS and I don't need to return back to work for someone else. This minimal requirement at least creates a chance to keep working and find the way to create the business in that "Right Way".

So the **Strategic Objective(metrics which I want business to achieve)** is reach the state where I can work 20 horus a week doing only only the Entrepreneurial, Managerial and possibly Sales and Marketing work and I don't do any technical work and YET I can take home enough money to survive ($200k/year) and I have enough profit to reinvest in the business (In fact I don't plan ever to take home more than $200k/year, because I want to keep investing in the business until it's sold).

### The facts about me

- I am 33 years old male in a perfect health, energy and mindset.
- Senior Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience.
- I am a PRO Generalist, not a Specialist (I may not be a super expert in one domain, but I am very good at fast learning and solving business problems from the first principles and then figuring out what has to be done to solve the problem). It does not mean that I HAVE TO be a generalist, I understand that it's a disaster on the market, it rather means that I can choose pretty confidently any narrow direction and bet that I'll be successful in it.
- My particular technical strengths are: AI(Prompt Engineering and Agentic Development), Web Development, Fast Prototyping/MVP Development, Business Automation, Proof of Concept Research, High-Level Architecture Design, Trade-Offs Analysis.
- I have $110k cash runway and no debts or any other financial obligations (it's approximately 1.5 years without any income).
- I am single, don't have or plan to have children.
- I am logistically flexible, I can live anywhere in the USA.
- I learn and dive into unknown contexts very fast.
- I don't have any network to leverage for my business.
- I don't have any particular strengths or preferences in any specific domain.
- I am originally from Russia and I have connections there, so I could potentially leverage the cheaper labor market and outsource some of the work there.

IMPORTANT NOTE: These are just facts, it does not mean that I HAVE TO leverage my strengths and not work on my weaknesses. It does not mean ANYTHING, they are just facts.

### My Current State

I'm stuck in decision paralysis about how to start my agency. I know I need to narrow my focus—doing "software development for anyone" won't work. I need to choose a specific customer segment and specific problems to solve. But I don't know how to choose. I have no criteria for selecting WHO to serve and WHAT to offer them.

I'm considering several approaches to figure this out:

- **Research market supply/demand** — Maybe this is the right approach. I could figure out how to do this.
- **Talk to experts who've done it** — Also a possibility I'm considering.
- **Consult books through AI** — I'm actively doing this right now. I upload books into advanced AI and ask if they can suggest something for my situation. I'm actually getting insights from this.
- **Brainstorm niches and try blindly** — This is what everyone suggests, but it feels wrong to me. "Just pick any niche and problem" sounds stupid without reasoning behind it.
- **Talk to potential customers to explore problems** — But how do I even choose which potential customers? Blindly? That also feels wrong. And then talking to them also feels like it might be a waste of time.
- **Interview existing agency owners** — I tried this once and got insights. This is actually what I'm thinking to continue doing.

I'm caught between two fears:

1. **Analysis paralysis** — I don't want to overthink and never start
2. **Stupid decisions** — I don't want to act randomly without reason

I talked to one agency owner so far. He never did customer research, has no time to talk to customers because he's too busy building, and struggles to get new customers. I know I don't want to end up like him.

**Bottom line:** I need a systematic way to choose my niche that's neither random guessing nor endless research. I'm actively consulting books through AI and considering continuing to interview agency owners, but I'm unsure what approach would actually move me forward without wasting my runway.

### The Execution plan

After talking to Gemini 3 Pro, we agreed on the **"Agency-First Scientific Discovery"** approach. This method leverages my cash runway ($110k) to treat business building as an engineering problem (Requirements -> Research -> Architecture -> Build), minimizing the risk of building the wrong thing.

#### 1. Alternatives Considered & Rejected

We evaluated the following common paths and rejected them based on my specific Strategic Objectives:

- **The Generalist Mercenary (Upwork/Toptal):** REJECTED.
  - _Why:_ Selling raw coding hours creates a job, not a business. It violates the goal of removing myself from operations because clients buy _me_, not a system.
- **The "Builder" (Micro-SaaS/Indie Hacker):** REJECTED.
  - _Why:_ High risk of "Solution looking for a problem." Without a verified market, I risk burning months building software nobody wants. Marketing is the bottleneck here, and I lack an audience.
- **The Technical Co-Founder:** REJECTED.
  - _Why:_ Violates the "Primary Aim" of independence and self-evolution. Splitting equity and control reduces the pressure to master sales/marketing myself.
- **Narrow Problem + Broad Customer (Horizontal):** REJECTED.
  - _Why:_ Creates "Implementation Hell." Business logic varies too wildly between industries (e.g., Billing for Lawyers vs. Billing for Bakeries), preventing code reuse and systematization.
- **Narrow Customer + Broad Problem (The IT Guy):** REJECTED.
  - _Why:_ Creates the "Consultant Trap." Solving every random IT problem for a niche leads to high engagement but zero scalability. I become an external employee rather than a solution provider.

#### 2. The Chosen Path: Agency-First Scientific Discovery

We chose a rigorous validation path that prioritizes **Signal (Data)** over **Noise (Busyness)**.

**Step 1: Define Selection Criteria (The Filter)**

- Establish a strict checklist of what constitutes a "Good Niche" for _me_ (e.g., Budget size, Tech maturity, Accessibility). This prevents analysis paralysis by filtering the infinite market down to a manageable list.

**Step 2: Source Discovery (Agency Interviews)**

- Interview 5-10 existing Agency Owners.
- _The Goal:_ Identify their "Hidden Winners"—specific client types that are highly profitable for them, even if the agency is currently mismanaged.
- _The Logic:_ Leverage their years of "tuition" to find a niche that is already spending money on services.

**Step 3: Select & Research Shortlist**

- Select 3 promising niches based on Step 2 data.
- Conduct "Deep Dive" (OSINT) research on their business models to identify Value Buckets (Sales, Operations, Finance) and formulate sharp workflow questions.

**Step 4: Customer Validation (The Truth Check)**

- Interview 5-7 actual business owners within the selected niches.
- _The Method:_ Use "The Mom Test" style inquiry (focus on past behaviors/problems, not opinions).
- _The Goal:_ Confirm a "Bleeding Neck" problem that is urgent, expensive, and frequent.

**Step 5: Build & Sell**

- Only _after_ confirming the Niche (Who) and the Problem (What), use my "Pro Generalist" skills to Architect and Build the Solution (How).
